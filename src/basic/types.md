# Types

There are 3 basic data types in Go languages which are:
1. Numbers: numbers are divided into three sub-categories that are:
- Integers: In Golang, there are 4(four) different sizes for both signed and unsigned integers

| Data Type | Description                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| int8      | 8-bit signed integer, range -128 to 127                   |
| int16     | 16-bit signed integer, range -(2^15) to (2^15)-1          |
| int32     | 32-bit signed integer, range -(2^31) to (2^31)-1          |
| int64     | 64-bit signed integer, range -(2^63) to (2^63)-1          |
| uint8     | 8-bit unsigned integer, range 0 to 255                    |
| uint16    | 16-bit unsigned integer, range 0 to (2^16)-1              |
| uint32    | 32-bit unsigned integer, range 0 to (2^32)-1              |
| uint64    | 64-bit unsigned integer, range 0 to (2^64)-1              |
| int       | Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit. |
| uint      | Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit. |
| byte      | It is a synonym of uint8.                                 |

- Float Numbers

| Data Type | Description                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| float32   | 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number |
| float64   | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number |

- Complex Numbers

| Data Type  | Description                                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| complex64  | Complex numbers which contain float32 as a real and imaginary component. |
| complex128 | Complex numbers which contain float64 as a real and imaginary component. |

2. Booleans

3. Strings
